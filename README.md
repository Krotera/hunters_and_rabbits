# Hunters and Rabbits
## What
A pygame GUI implementation of Hunters and Rabbits, 

"*a game in which, on each time-step, a collection of k hunters fire at k vertices of a graph. On one of those vertices is an invisible rabbit, which is forced to move along an edge to a new vertex after each round of shots. We determine the minimum number of hunters needed to guarantee a kill for uniform blowups of general graphs, for arbi- trary blowups of paths, for infinite rays and paths, and for the Cartesian product of a path with a cycle. We also give partial results for infinite trees and for the arbitrary blowup of a cycle, and conjecture the general answer for the latter.*"
