# Hunters and Rabbits
## What
A [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) implementation of Hunters and Rabbits, 

"*a game in which, on each time-step, a collection of k hunters fire at k vertices of a graph. On one of those vertices is an invisible rabbit, which is forced to move along an edge to a new vertex after each round of shots.*"

Alfaro, Blankenship, Cummings, & Humburg. "Hunters and Rabbits on Path- and Cycle-like Graphs." (2019)

## How
Running `hunters_and_rabbits.py` should open a browser window or tab with the running Dash app. 

Use the GUI there to load a graph file (see `example_graph.xml` for the format), and it'll be displayed as a network graph with clickable vertices. Fire at *k* vertices, press *GO* to recolor the graph, and repeat. 

Happy hunting.
